# NoShows
My take on the https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments dataset

### Primary Goal: What if that possible to predict someone to no-show an appointment?

#### Project Outline:
1. Data Cleaning & EDA
2. Feature Selection & Creation
3. Model Training
4. Model Testing 
5. Conclusions
6. Deliverable


#### Repo Structure: 
* develop 
* deliver
* figures
* src
* data

Repository structure inspired by [Jupyter Notebook Best Practices for Data Science](https://www.svds.com/jupyter-notebook-best-practices-for-data-science/)
