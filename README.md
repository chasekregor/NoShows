# NoShows
My take on the https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments dataset

### Primary Goal: Can we predict if a patient is or isn't going to show up for a medical appointment?

#### Project Outline:
1. Data Cleaning & EDA
2. Feature Selection & Creation
3. Model Training
4. Model Testing
5. Conclusions
6. Deliverable

### Results:
Maybe..? I wasn't able to at least, not with this dataset. I wasn't able to derive any predictions better than human intuition. Maybe with a more robust dataset we might be able to. Or it simply isn't possible and there is a certain amount of randomness in the world that can't be predicted in these sorts of things.
